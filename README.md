# Reddit User Discussions Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing user discussions from Reddit forums. The analysis may involve extracting key topics, understanding user behavior, or examining the context of discussions. The project includes datasets from Reddit forums and a Jupyter notebook for data processing and analysis.

## Directory Structure

### Data Files
- **Reddit-Forum-CaseStudy-Dataset (1).csv**: Contains user discussions extracted from a specific Reddit forum, possibly annotated with various features such as user interaction metrics, timestamps, and comment text.
- **Reddit-Google-maps-dataset-Integrated (2).csv**: Another dataset integrating discussions related to Google Maps on Reddit. This dataset might include comments about user experiences, suggestions, or issues related to Google Maps.

### Code Files
- **Extracting_End_User_discussion_Reddit.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook for processing and analyzing the Reddit discussions. This notebook likely includes steps for data cleaning, feature extraction, and initial exploratory data analysis.

### README.md
- This file contains information about the project, including how to set up and use the provided code and datasets.

## Requirements

To run the experiments and code provided in this repository, you will need the following:

- **Python 3.x**: The project is developed using Python.
- **Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab**: Recommended for running and interacting with the `.ipynb` notebooks.
- **Python Libraries**:
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - `numpy`: For numerical computations.
  - `matplotlib` or `seaborn`: For data visualization.
  - `scikit-learn`: For traditional machine learning models and preprocessing (if applicable).

## Running the Analysis

### 1. Data Overview
- Begin by exploring the **Reddit-Forum-CaseStudy-Dataset (1).csv** and **Reddit-Google-maps-dataset-Integrated (2).csv** files to familiarize yourself with the data. This will help you understand the structure and the kind of information available in these datasets.

### 2. Data Processing
- Use the **Extracting_End_User_discussion_Reddit.ipynb** notebook to preprocess the data. Preprocessing steps might include:
  - Cleaning the text data (removing special characters, stopwords, etc.).
  - Tokenizing the text for analysis.
  - Extracting features such as word counts, user interaction metrics, or sentiment.

### 3. Data Analysis
- Depending on your research goals, the analysis could involve:
  - Topic modeling to identify key themes in the discussions.
  - Sentiment analysis to gauge the overall sentiment of the discussions.
  - User behavior analysis to understand interaction patterns on Reddit.

## Data Description

- **Reddit-Forum-CaseStudy-Dataset (1).csv**: Contains user comments from Reddit forums. Features may include comment text, user interaction data, timestamps, and other relevant information.
- **Reddit-Google-maps-dataset-Integrated (2).csv**: This dataset likely includes discussions related to Google Maps, with features similar to the first dataset.
