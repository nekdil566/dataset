I got the idea from their business model: collect data on your so you can sell curated access to them through a advertisement marketplace (AdWords). They never, ever, actually sold raw data. They use the data to categorise users into different groups for advertisers to target. The better the specific groups are, the higher the CTR of conversion rate is.

If Google would sell raw data (which they do not actually do), they would lose competitiveness against ad-space sellers. Those sellers could theoretically easily match the bought userdata and couple it to their own profile of a specific user. That data would improve the competitor's market, hurting Google's position in the process.

So no, I've never seen a single credible article claiming actual user data is sold by Google. Google would never allow such a stupidity to hurt the trusted position they currently have. **Have you seen the obnoxious amount of money they make by selling ad-space alone?** Selling raw data would hurt the trust their users have in them. This would result in less users, or at least a lowered willingness to provide Google with data. That process would make them lose money.

It's not that it forgets playback location within an episode, it's that I have to re-navigate the entire UI in-between every episode.

When an episode ends, it stops playback.  I then have to hit the music icon to go back to Pocketcasts, and it doesn't take me right back to the list of episodes within my filter so I can just click the next one.

I think what you're saying is that if I build up the queue with hours of content, and start it playing before entering Android Auto, then it will keep playing through the entire queue that was already running without stopping between episodes, right?  This sounds like it might work.  There's no way to deal with the queue once you're in Android Auto, but if it is started before then maybe it keeps going.

For instance: if I'm driving someplace unfamiliar, I'll ask Maps for directions.  But if the first step is ""get on Highway X northbound"", I don't need turn-by-turn information on how to do that - I *know* how to do that, and Google probably *knows* that I know.  So they could replace the first half of the directions with ""get on Highway X northbound"", and tell me what exit to get off at, and only start giving full turn-by-turn directions once I get off the freeway at the other end, where I probably don't know what to do.

That's the single biggest issue with the app that I see currently exists.

Too many colors are shared between the route that you are on, and other parts of the UI.  Red and orange are used on routes other than the ones you are on, which can be distracting if you glance down and see a bunch of red, but none of it actually affects the way you are going.  

Also where you have been, should be a different color than where you are going.  This can be confusing when taking an exist off a highway that loops around and how you have a bunch of blue roads.  If you are trying to pay attention to the road and only glance at the map occasionally, this can be extremely distracting.

> Just wondering, but do you guys use Google Maps to navigate to things that you know where they are?

Always, because it's good to have a bead on whether any navigation app is giving you accurate, reasonable directions or simply insane. 

I immediately crossed Waze off my acceptable apps list when it directed me to NOT continue a mile straight down a main thoroughfare toward my closest cross street - which only has three potential lights, only one of which would likely catch me -  and has a 45 mph speed limit, instead directing me to veer off into a residential neighborhood, snaking through 25 mph zones with at least SIX stop signs AND a major cross street which almost certainly would hold you up. Instead of driving two minutes in a straight line, it wanted to add at least five minutes and a bunch of mandatory stops. That's insanity.

Even Google Maps can sometimes brainfart. The other day I realize it really swung me waaaay out of my way for no adequate reason. OTOH, when going to the movies the other afternoon, it knew that there was construction on the usual street the theater is on, so it told me to get off an exit early and take a parallel street up. Nice.

I also use it on my morning commute because I'm on a strict punch-in schedule (literally a 5-minute window starting before your start time; i.e. if you start at 9:00, you can only punch in between 8:55 and 9:00 before management looks funny at you) and if there's something up ahead on my 23-mile commute that's going to break my ETA, I can go to an alternate site to clock in that's closer. I find the ETA to be a couple of minutes later than my actual arrival time, probably due to exceeding the speed limit for self-preservation.",cs7ypxr,2,cs7tup4,claim,attacking ,yes,

Yeah, Waze eventually stops being stupid. OTOH, Google is more likely correct the first time. You just need to keep an eye on when it wants you to drive many miles further in order to save a couple of minutes. One trip I take offers a freeway route that's fastest but almost 10 miles longer. The non-freeway route takes perhaps 5 minutes longer, but you save a buck in gas at least.",cs8ukxr,1,cs8qpv6,claim,attacking ,yes,

"I'm a major contributor to Google Maps, so have been trying Waze both to see how a competing app works and also due to Google owning it.  I'm now almost obsessed with seeing just how bad it is.

I use it every morning on my short commute to work.  It's advertised to learn you favourite route.  It took forever to learn I turn left as I leave home to avoid trying to turn left onto a major artery from a stop sign.  But some weeks it forgets.  After several months hasn't learned yet that I approach work from the back due to assigned parking spots.

Some days it decides my work is where it is marked on Google Maps (front door of a building with parking lot roads out front), some days it decides my work is the point on the major artery out front that the address is estimated to be at.  This is despite the fact it asks me every morning if I'm going to work and I just confirm.

Once it has to reroute when I approach work from the rear, it chooses a convoluted route that complete circles two blocks.  I used Waze's map editor to correct the fact that you can turn left into parking lots, and that fixed it... kind of.  Some days it gives the proper route, some days it circles the blocks.

The conclusion... neat tool, but too unreliable with no reason for it to be so.",cs835pk,1,cs814nz,claim,attacking ,yes,
"Waze works amazingly for me. It might have to do with the fact that I live in a very urban environment with wildly unpredictable traffic and not that many viable alternatives for the routes I generally take. When it routes me through smaller streets, it's almost always worth the effort.

My biggest complaint is that it is really wonky with tunnels lately. And that they need an algorithm for merging. e.g. There is a highway where traffic moves fine but the lane to merge onto another highway always backs up terribly but Waze can only see that the road is moving fine and can't reconcile some people moving fast and others moving slow.

If I say it's slow, it then displays on the map for others to see that the freeway is now going 43 km/h; no mater what is the real speed (usually closer to 20 km/h).

What tangible benefits does Google get for improving the experience for people who are already using their products on their own platform without any alternative? What benefits do they get from *expanding* their ecosystem by making their service products more attractive on a competing platform?

Google cares less about whether you use Android or iOS than they care that *if* you use iOS, you *still use use Google Maps* over Apple Maps (or Hangouts over iMessage), and so they direct their investment accordingly.

Personally, I think Google may have decided to simply let Apple deliver users to their ecosystem on the high end of the smartphone market, and so they need to keep their software products competitive on iOS. While for Android they are prioritizing the markets that nobody else can deliver to them - lower end and â€œcheapâ€� but still good (enough) devices in emerging markets. 

Why spend energy to duplicate and compete against the market that Apple is giving to you already?

Imagine a team having to only test their code on 10 devices before releasing an update. That's basically ios. 

Now imagine quite literally hundreds if not thousands of different devices with different software versions and screen sizes and processors and other configurations all expecting that same code to work.

Apple Maps is still a thing?,d4tb5ou,18,d4t1jfh,feature,,yes,
Apple thinks it is.,d4tvm08,3,d4tb5ou,claim,supporting ,yes,
"I know for us Android users Apple Maps is something of a joke, but I wager that most iPhone users use Apple Maps just on the basis of it being the default app.",d4tw93m,2,d4tvm08,claim,attacking,yes,
"I'm a long time android user that switched to an iPhone.... Apple maps is actually pretty good, especially with the watch.",d4tyxah,1,d4tw93m,claim,attacking,yes,
"Can confirm, my wife uses Apple Maps all the time since she's on iPhone and it's the default.  I learned rather quickly that I can't ask her to look anything up when we're driving somewhere because Apple Maps has given us awful directions on a number of occasions.

It takes the long way around all the time, it's taken us to the wrong place on a number of occasions, and once just for kicks and giggles, Apple Maps decided it wanted me to get off the freeway only to tell me to get right back on.

I don't know how people keep using that garbage service...",d4uf6w7,2,d4tw93m,claim,attacking,yes,

An app that'll order pizza for me? What a great time to be alive!,d4t4997,27,d4t1jfh,issue,,yes,
It puts the routes in order. It doesn't order pizza. But you can order from Dominos with an emoji or something idk. ,d4t7258,41,d4t4997,claim,attacking,yes,
You can order Dominos with a Pebble...,d4ue0vj,1,d4t7258,claim,neu,no,

With a motherfucking smartwatch. ,d4tb0oy,1,d4t7258,claim,neu,no,
He you can order dominos by opening an app and doing nothing else. They make it do easy. If they didn't get rid of the shop runner deal I would order from them all of the time.,d4t8hxl,15,d4t7258,claim,neu,no,
What's the shop runner deal? ,d4tb1ml,3,d4t8hxl,claim,neu,no,
Shop runner is a service similar to Amazon prime (free 2 day delivery on a few sites) and it also included free dominos delivery.,d4tbt0d,3,d4tb1ml,claim,neu,no,
"It used to be a deal they had with Shoprunner. If you were a shoprunner member, there was no delivery fee.

I got a free 1-year shoprunner membership. This was 4+ years ago and I still get all the benefits. But the dominos was definitely the best.",d4tbgv9,6,d4tb1ml,claim,neu,no,
"Shop runner is free if you have an Amex card.

Yup. I have one of the old free accounts they gave away and it still works. I use it for Newegg and a few other places.,d4tcgbc,6,d4tbgv9,claim,neu,no,
I have one of those too. Never did figure out why it hasn't stopped working.,d4tonkt,1,d4tcgbc,claim,neu,no,
I think it just comes free with American express. ,d4tnmbb,2,d4tcgbc,claim,neu,no,
"Heck, Everquest 2 had (maybe still has, I'm not sure) the /pizza command which would open up Pizza Hut's ordering page.",d4td7yr,16,d4t8hxl,claim,neu,no,
EQ1 had that!,d4xf3hp,1,d4td7yr,claim,neu,no,
"I do believe there's a WoW Addon that you pre-program with your favourite toppings and such, and which place you prefer delivery from, and when you whack a button, a pizza shows up 30 to 45 minutes later.

Seems dangerous. I hit the wrong buttons all the damn time.",d4tpoyg,4,d4td7yr,claim,neu,no,
"Hehe, I was a Healer ,and I had a macro that dished out all the damn cooldowns and hardest heals in like 2 seconds flat. I called it the Idiot button because the only times I had to dish out so much healing was when someone did something very, very stupid. Like Pulling half of the dungeon.",d4tvr5b,1,d4tpoyg,claim,neu,no,
Hitting the 'order pizza button' is never the wrong button.,d4tv22i,6,d4tpoyg,claim,neu,no,
"Needs to be in-app, otherwise it's unweildy and time-consuming, though I did use similar software to route my drivers when I worked for a place with daily delivery routes.",d4t2ivw,80,d4t1jfh,feature,,yes,
